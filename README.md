# comp90015.proj2
Project 2 (a Master/Worker job system) for Distributed Systems at The University of Melbourne.

## git
Workflow:

1. Checkout master
2. Create a new branch to work in
3. Do work in the new branch
4. Repull into the new branch from master to resolve merge conflicts
5. Pull request the new branch back into master and wait for review/approval from someone else

Branch names should identify the feature/component being worked on and who is responsible for it; eg. `nedp/job-starting`

Remember to add any user-specific project settings files (eg. for IDEs) to .gitignore.
